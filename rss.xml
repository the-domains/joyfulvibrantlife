            <title><![CDATA[A Gift for Spending Money]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Gift for Spending Money</h1><p>There is a new herbalist who set up shop near my town. I went in today to get an herbal tea to soothe my senses and fortify my body. It wasn’t a large purchase by any means. And more than obtaining the tea, I wanted to meet and connect with this lady and welcome her to our healing community. We had a lovely conversation which I hope leads to more community connection and expansion in the future.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/494618db-8ee8-4cfa-b8de-c8b305be00c3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Prosperity is More than Just Money</h1><h2>Do you know that it’s impossible to escape from abundance?</h2><p>When most people think of prosperity they think of having a lot of money. While financial abundance is the common definition of prosperity, it is not the only definition. Prosperity can also be defined as “thriving” and “flourishing”. There is a common misconception that if you are financially prosperous you are thriving and flourishing.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/41137e92-f179-46a3-a499-caa93345844f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The Natural Flow of Exchange]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Natural Flow of Exchange</h1><p>Every living thing has a balance which is dependent upon exchange for its well-being. It requires each entity to provide something of value that the other entity can take in and use. In that process of exchange something must also be released. Consider the relationship we have to trees. We take in the oxygen that trees produce. In order to inhale the oxygen we must release the carbon dioxide from our lungs by exhaling. The trees can then take in the carbon dioxide for nourishment and then make the oxygen that they release for us to use. The give and take happens so naturally that we don’t even think about it.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6ce944be-6dc2-40b7-979e-5d4047040545.jpg"></article>]]></description>
