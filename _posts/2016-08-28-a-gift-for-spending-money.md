  There is a new herbalist who set up shop near my town. I went in today to get
  an herbal tea to soothe my senses and fortify my body. It wasnâ€™t a large
  purchase by any means. And more than obtaining the tea, I wanted to meet and
  connect with this lady and welcome her to our healing community. We had a
  lovely conversation which I hope leads to more community connection and
  expansion in the future.

# A Gift for Spending Money

There is a new herbalist who set up shop near my town. I went in today to get an herbal tea to soothe my senses and fortify my body. It wasn't a large purchase by any means. And more than obtaining the tea, I wanted to meet and connect with this lady and welcome her to our healing community. We had a lovely conversation which I hope leads to more community connection and expansion in the future.

When I returned home and unpacked my tea I got a little pleasant surprise. She had tucked a little reminder in my package about the importance of spending money.

> The trick with spending money lies in knowing, with every fiber of your being, that it will return. AND SO IT MUST. AS IF ON WINGS..... The Universe"

A lovely reminder and a lovely little gift!
