  Every living thing has a balance which is dependent upon exchange for its
  well-being. It requires each entity to provide something of value that the
  other entity can take in and use. In that process of exchange something must
  also be released. Consider the relationship we have to trees. We take in the
  oxygen that trees produce. In order to inhale the oxygen we must release the
  carbon dioxide from our lungs by exhaling. The trees can then take in the
  carbon dioxide for nourishment and then make the oxygen that they release for
  us to use. The give and take happens so naturally that we donâ€™t even think
  about it.

# The Natural Flow of Exchange

Every living thing has a balance which is dependent upon exchange for its well-being. It requires each entity to provide something of value that the other entity can take in and use. In that process of exchange something must also be released. Consider the relationship we have to trees. We take in the oxygen that trees produce. In order to inhale the oxygen we must release the carbon dioxide from our lungs by exhaling. The trees can then take in the carbon dioxide for nourishment and then make the oxygen that they release for us to use. The give and take happens so naturally that we don't even think about it.

Why then is it often difficult for humans to translate the natural flow of exchange for the purpose of well-being into more sophisticated experiences? We tend to get confused, for example, about how to exchange our gifts in a way which allows us to take care of our physical needs and thrive. Often money or support in other forms doesn't come in the way we expect, and we're left to grapple with survival instead of floating in the immense sea of abundance that we know instinctively is here for us. So what gets in the way of the natural exchange of money and resources in all forms that we're here to have?
