**Prosperity is More than Just Money**

When most people think of prosperity they think of having a lot of money. While financial abundance is the common definition of prosperity it is not the only definition. Prosperity can also be defined as "thriving" and "flourishing". There is a common misconception that if you are financially prosperous you are thriving and flourishing. 

What if the ability to thrive and flourish is really the foundation for true prosperity? What if, in a sustainable system, the money is just the byproduct when you stabilize all the other areas of your life?

I'm not saying that the key to wealth is to bliss out and float aimlessly through life. When it comes to the actual mechanics of making and keeping and growing money, you do have to have some practical skills and knowledge about how to manage your finances. I'm just saying that all the financial management skills in the world aren't going to lead you to the factors which sustain you in the long run. As we have seen in the world financial markets in recent years....

**Shaky Foundation = Shaky Finances**

Most of the organizations and structures which are here for the sole purpose of making money aren't doing so well right now. If you look at organizations which are making money as a result of their connection and service to other people, you can feel the difference in how they flourish.

You can thrive and flourish in amazingly vibrant ways. But if you are stuck in the pursuit of money for survival, and don't have the other foundational pieces which truly support you in place, your ability to prosper is always going to be shaky and inconsistent.

**Your Foundation for Prosperity -- The Abundance Wheel**

Do you know that it's impossible to escape from abundance? We humans are creating beings and where we place our intentions determines what shows up in abundant amounts. It shows up in response to our thoughts, feelings and actions. You can have an abundance of anything, even scarcity!

The Abundance Wheel below identifies 4 areas of life which are essential for thriving in a prosperous and positive way. The specifics of each category may overlap, and what you put on your wheel may even be slightly different. If you were to lay this wheel out flat it would serve as a platform on which you can stand and reach for higher things knowing that you are well supported.

What does your abundance wheel contain? In what areas of your life / abundance wheel are you not fulfilled? How does this affect your foundation for prosperity?
