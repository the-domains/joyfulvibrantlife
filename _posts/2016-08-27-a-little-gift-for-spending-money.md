  There is a new herbalist who set up shop near my town. I went in today to get
  an herbal tea to soothe my senses and fortify my body. It wasnâ€™t a large

  lovely conversation which I hope leads to more community connection and
  expansion in the future.

# A Little Gift for Spending Money

There is a new herbalist who set up shop near my town. I went in today to get an herbal tea to soothe my senses and fortify my body. It wasn't a large purchase by any means. And more than obtaining the tea, I wanted to meet and connect with this lady and welcome her to our healing community. We had a lovely conversation which I hope leads to more community connection and expansion in the future.

When I returned home and unpacked my tea I got a little pleasant surprise. She had tucked a little reminder in my package about the importance of spending money. 

"The trick with spending money lies in knowing, with every fiber of your being, that it will return. AND SO IT MUST. AS IF ON WINGS..... The Universe"

A lovely reminder and a lovely little gift!
